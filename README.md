The purpose of this project is to create a simple game of rock, paper, and scissors between a computer and a player orginally played through the DevTools console. The skills demonstrated are a basic understanding and use of variables, data types, operators, conditionals, functions, and loops in JavaScript.

For the current iteration of this project, the player will be able to make their choice using by pressing buttons on the page instead of typing in a prompt, and the results of the game will be displayed in the page itself instead of being in the console. The skills demonstrated are as before, with the addition of a basic understanding of the document object model (DOM), and JavaScript events.
